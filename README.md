# salary-dispersion
How does salary dispersion affect team performance? Interested in the relationship between how management allocate their salaries and team success in professional sports over the years. Many have found a positive correlation between team payroll and team success by measuring different metrics like team revenues to their total number of wins. These studies encompass multiple major sport leagues in the US and Canada; however, the NBA has drawn the most attention from fans and sport writers alike. Over the past several years, the salary cap has increased drastically, which has not only led to higher pay of superstar athletes, but allowed his residing team to sign another star athlete due to the team’s increased salary cap. Ultimately, I was successful when it came to confirming these findings but using data from the most recent NBA seasons and different measures of salary dispersion.
